  Welcome to the Custom Arcade Controller tutorial! This tutorial is intended for the construction
  of a controller for [Sound Voltex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Voltex), but the
  fundamentals will be applicable for any custom arcade controller.

  <!--Hi! this is just a sample **intro text**. You would normally put your [full name](about/) here and say something *smart* about yourself.

  This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you [do for a living](work/) and maybe what you are [interested in](projects/). You might also be [writing](articles/) about stuff.

  But after all this is your site and I'm just a **placeholder text** so what would i know about some *home page content*. -->
