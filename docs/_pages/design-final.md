# Finishing Touches

Now that you have all the parts needed for the controller, it's time to finish the
design. Make sure to go through and verify all you parts and their measurements
before you finalize the design. Multiple measurements and checks will help to avoid
mistakes later in design and construction.

# Parts To Design

Following this tutorial, you will need to design 4 major parts:

-   The Top Plate
-   The Middle Plate
-   The Frame
-   The Bottom Plate

The frame is the main structural element of the controller. It gives the controller
shape and forms the backbone for mounting. Everything will be mounted to the frame
so it will need to be sturdy.

Apart from the frame, the next most important structural elements of an arcade are the mounting plates.
The primary plates are the top and bottom plates although more may be used.
The top plate is the surface that will be seen the most as it holds the buttons for the controller.
A middle plate may be used to offer an additional mounting surface and reinforce the top.
The bottom plate provides a resting surface for the controller and keeps all of the inside parts
hidden away and protected. All plates will be mounted to the frame.<sup>1</sup>

## Equipment and Supplies

In order to design the partss, you will need both software for design and the hardware you intend to use for construction.

You will need the following software:

2D or 3D Computer Aided Design  (CAD) Program such as Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks

It is expected that you are familiar with the use of your specific CAD program. In this instruction manual, Autodesk Inventor Professional 2017 will be used.

You will need the following hardware:

-   Buttons
-   Knobs
-   Joysticks
-   Measuring instruments such as calipers
-   Screws
-   Material for the plates such as acrylic or wood

<i>Note: It is expected that you have already determined the dimensions of the frame for the controller. The frame dimensions will be necessary for the dimensions of the plates.</i>

## The Frame

Since the frame gives the final shape and dimensions, the frame should be finalized
first. For the thickness of the frame, you will need to ensure that it can enclose
the entirety of the buttons with microswitches. These will most likely be the parts
requiring the most depth, but be sure to check others in case they exceed the depth
needs of the buttons. For the purposes of experiencing both sides of design, the
frame will be finalized using traditional pen and paper.

1.  Determine the interior dimensions of the frame.

  These dimensions will be the maximum interior size of the frame. All components
  must be contained within the confines of the interior. The exterior dimensions
  will be determined by the thickness of the frame material. Draw the interior shape
  on your paper, ensuring to mark the dimensions.

2.  Determine the exterior dimensions of the frame.

  Assuming a rectangular frame, two of the pieces will share the interior dimensions.
  The other two pieces will have a final size of Length + 2 * (Material Thickness).

  The frame is a simple start to the controller, but lays the foundation for all other
  work. Double check your measurements and math after design and throughout construction.

## The Plates

### Setup

Before beginning the plate designs, you will need the measurements and spacing for each component. Your preliminary paper design will serve as a baseline for the final
design.

(1) Using the calipers or other measurement tools, measure the dimensions of each component. Pay special attention the dimensions for mounting holes or surfaces.

(2) Using the dimensions for the frame, make a preliminary plate layout. Be sure to include screw holes for mounting to the frame and all button mounting points. This may be a simple sketch on paper.

<i>Note: different buttons use different mounting styles. Some may have a top lip that will keep it flush with the top of a plate and allow it to be sandwiched in place with a bracket from below. Others may require a screw to mount to the plate.</i>

### Finalizing the Plates

Now that you have the required dimensions, you may model the each of the plates that you will need. This will cover the design for the top plate. Each subsequent plate may be modeled in the same style. You may even edit a copy of the top plate to accelerate the process.

(1) Open a new 2D sketch in your CAD program of choice. Autodesk Inventor Professional 2017 will be used in this example.

(2) Create a rectangle with the dimensions matching the frame.

(3) Add each mounting hole to the plate. Use dimension tools to define the hole size and spacing.

(4) Use the pattern repeat tool to add screw holes around the edge of the plate.

(5) Use the top plate as a template for every other plate. Repeat steps 1-4 for each plate. Ensure button holes and screw holes line up properly in each plate

(6) If you will be using a laser cutter, export each plate as either a PDF, .dxwg, or other file that is accepted by your laser cutter.
