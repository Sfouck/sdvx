## Using Your Tools

For the plates, a laser cutter was used. This may not be accessible for all people,
but it makes manufacturing much more simple. The same results could be achieved
using a jig saw.

## Equipment

  - Epilog 40W Laser Cutter <sup>1</sup>

## Materials

  - Acrylic sheets

## Software

  - Corel Draw (for the laser cutter) <sup>2</sup>

## Import the CAD Files

  (1) Open Corel Draw

  (2) File->Import the cad file for your plate

  (3) On import, ensure to select the correct orientation of the cad file. Make sure
  it shows up correctly on the canvas.

## Cutting the Plates

<b> BE SURE TO TEST ON SCRAP MATERIAL FIRST </b>

<i>Note: You may wish to keep the paper cover on your acrylic to avoid burn marks. </i>

  (1) Align the plate in the laser cutter.

  (2) Set the focus on the plate.

  (3) Ensure the cut is aligned properly in Corel Draw.

  (4) Using the system dialog, print to the laser cutter. Ensure settings for power, speed,
  and frequency are correct for your specific material.

  (5) Supervise the laser cutter as it cuts. Should material catch on fire, open
  the lid to extinguish flames.

  (6) Repeat for each plate.

## Cleanup

At this point, the plates are essentially complete. Remove any cut fragments that
may be stuck after laser cutting. The paper or plasic wrap that comes on acrylic
may also be removed at this point or later during final assembly. Acrylic can be
engraved or painted for a personalized design. Any scratches may be removed by
wet sanding and polishing with a very fine grit sand paper.

## Next Steps

Your parts should all be complete at this point. Now you can assemble your controller.
