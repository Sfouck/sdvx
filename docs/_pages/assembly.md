## Putting it Together

Now that your parts are complete, it's time to put them together! Before actually
assembling everything, it may be a good idea to test the fit of all parts before
proceeding. This will allow any errors to be corrected before they become a larger
problem.

## Preparation

The plates will be attached to the frame using screws. To make this easier,
pre-tap the holes for each screw.

  (1) Line up the plates on the frame.

  (2) Using the holes in the plates as guides, pre-drill holes into the frame.
  Make sure to use a drill size smaller than the screw you will be using to ensure
  the threads will catch.

## Fit the buttons

Each button has a different style of attachment. The buttons used here have a
screw on base and upper lip that sandwich the button onto a hole in the acrylic.

  (1) Unscrew the holders from the buttons.

  (2) Line up the buttons within the holes on the plates.

  (3) Screw on the holder from below.

  (4) Attach the microswitch (and LEDs if available) for each button.

## Fit the Encoders

Rotary encoders will be srewed on to the top plate. The knobs will be attached to
the shafts after the encoders are attached.

  (1) Line up the rotary encoder on the top plate. Ensure wires are facing inwards
  to avoid collision with the frame.

  (2) Attach with screws to the plate.

## Attaching the Plates

The middle and top plates will be attached to the top of the frame. The bottom plate
will be attached to the bottom of the frame. Do not attach the bottom plate until
everything is completely done. You will need access to the wiring until the controller
is functioning properly.

  (1) Align the middle plate and top plate on top of the frame. Ensure parts do not
  cause collisions with the frame.

  <i>Note: My initial design failed to account for the space on the topmost button.
  A router was needed to cut out a pocket in the frame for the button to have space.</i>

  (2) Attach the plates to the frame with screws.

## The Bottom Plate

The bottom plate may be held in place with tape until access to the interior is no
longer necessary. Mount in the same manner as the other plates. Rubber feet may be
affixed to the bottom plate to provide grip on a table surface.

## Next Steps

The controller is nearing completion! It just needs wiring and programming to be
functional.
