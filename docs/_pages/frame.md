## Beginning construction

Now that your design is complete, it's time to get building! It's also a great
time to double check all your measurements and parts before you take any irreversable
actions. In addition, start getting familiar with the tools you will be using.
For the frame, basic hand tools or power tools will be the only necessary tools.
Being familiar with their operation will make the process much easier and smoother.
Practice using each tool you intend to use on scrap material in order to get the
best results.

## Equipment

  - Miter Saw or circular saw
  - Drill
  - Clamps

## Materials

  - Frame material, wood in this example
  - Screws or nails

## First Cuts

  (1) Looking at your frame design, determine the lengths of each frame piece.

  (2) Mark each length on your material.

  (3) Using your saw, cut material on the mark. Clamp material before cutting for to improve the cut.

  <i>Note: You may want to cut a small hole on the bottom side of one frame piece
  to allow for a cable to be threaded through.</i>

## Assembling the Frame

The frame can be nailed or screwed together from the outside for a simple assembly,
but attaching from the inside will provide the best looking exterior finish.

  (1) Using the inside frame parts (the parts whose edges will be pressed against
    another frame part), predrill holes for screws. A jig may be very useful for this process.

  (2) Clamp frame sections together and drill screws into the existing holes.

  (3) Assemble the full frame.

## Finishing Touches

The frame is complete, but there's still more that can be done. Sanding the frame
and painting or staining will provide an even better exterior. Make it yours!

## Next Steps

Now that the frame is built, it's time for the plates!
